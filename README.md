# Bash Files

.bashrc, bash aliases, bash functions, ...

## Basics

The script `configure-bash.sh` creates some bash aliases and functions that might be helpful. The various files are sourced into your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
source ~/bash-files/.bash_aliases
source ~/bash-files/.bah_functions
source ~/bash-files/.bash_config
```

Additional aliases or functions can be added to these files. Feel free to ask me questions via Discord or make suggestions on what I need to add here.

## Usage

Clone repo:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/itsFelixH/bash-files
```

Run in bash shell:

``` bash
./bash-files/configure-bash.sh
```
